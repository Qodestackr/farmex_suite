File Conventions
Next.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:

layout	Shared UI for a segment and its children
page	Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible
loading	Loading UI for a segment and its children
not-found	Not found UI for a segment and its children
error	Error UI for a segment and its children
global-error	Global Error UI
route	Server-side API endpoint
template	Specialized re-rendered Layout UI
default	Fallback UI for Parallel Routes
Good to know: .js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.

Component Hierarchy
The React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

layout.js
template.js
error.js (React error boundary)
loading.js (React suspense boundary)
not-found.js (React error boundary)
page.js or nested layout.js
