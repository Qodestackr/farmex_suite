THEMES:
#074c3f
#096328
#29994f

<!-- 
Primary Green (#074c3f): This deep, dark green can serve as the primary color for backgrounds and headers, providing a sense of depth and sophistication.

Accent Green (#096328): A slightly lighter shade, perfect for accents, buttons, and highlighting key elements on your website.

Highlight Green (#29994f): A vibrant and refreshing green, ideal for calls to action, links, and other elements that you want to draw attention to.

Now, let's add a couple of supporting colors to complete the theme:

Dark Slate Gray (#2F4F4F): A dark neutral color that complements the deep primary green. This can be used for text or background contrast.

Steel Blue (#4682B4): A muted blue-gray that can add variety to the color palette. Use it for secondary elements or as an alternative to black.

Creamy White (#FFF8E1): A light, warm white that can be used for backgrounds or to add a touch of brightness to the design.

These colors together create a balanced and harmonious theme. Feel free to adjust the shades or let me know if you have specific preferences!
