Backend Infrastructure:

- Golang
- Nodejs (Serverless or any short-lived tasks)
- Python (Django REST)
- PostGIS
- GitHub Actions, Pulumi, Ansible, ELK Stack

// PLAN, START BUILDING, BUY DOMAIN, TRY AWS STARTUP CREDITS, BE READY TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT. WITH MVP READY, Move around looking
for something e.g introduce it on events, visit govt offices, or wherever (including competitors or whatever it takes). ABOVE ALL,
TAKE IT AS A JOURNEY TO LEARNING, DISCIPLINE, WORK ETHIC, AND JUST A NEW IDENTITY YOU WANNA BE IN FUTURE.

// Propose a rewarding : Cache, DevOps tools

// Django For Admin Panel
// AWS Aurora
// Spend Time Looking for a scalable AUTH SYSTEM - CERBOS, Cognito, ZITADEL, etc

// Docker and Docker Compose (reduce Kubernetes Friction)
// Serverless - Azure/ Lambda
// RabbitMQ
// Serverless Cache - Momento (For now)

// TOO MUCH AWS HEAVY STUFF TO COME LATER!!
//API Gateway: AWS API Gateway:

// Carto - Google Earth Engine

// CHALLENGE:
Django REST Framework (DRF) can be used to build APIs that interact with your Go backend. Essentially, you'll have Go handling the core backend logic and business processes, while DRF serves as the API layer for Django Admin. You can communicate between the Go backend and Django Admin using RESTful API endpoints.

GIS + Farm Application Development:
Geographic Information System (GIS) integration can be crucial for FarmCloud. Consider using GIS libraries or services like GeoDjango for spatial data management. This allows you to map and analyze agricultural data effectively. For values of tools and enablers, research existing GIS solutions, agricultural databases, and precision farming technologies to understand how they can enhance your application.

Define the core features essential for FarmCloud to function. An MVP could include features like user registration, daily work reporting, fertilizer and agrochemical application tracking, basic GIS mapping, and a simple admin panel. A reasonable timeframe for an MVP, considering your busy schedule, could be around 8-12 weeks. This allows you to make steady progress without compromising quality.

User Feedback Loop: Incorporate a feedback loop with potential users or farmers during the development process to ensure the application meets their needs.

Scalability: Design your architecture with scalability in mind, considering potential growth in user base and data.

Security: Implement robust security measures, especially when handling sensitive farm data.

Data Privacy: Address concerns related to data privacy and compliance with any relevant regulations.

Learning Resources: Continuously learn about new GIS tools, precision farming technologies, and advancements in agrotech to enhance FarmCloud.

Collaboration: If possible, collaborate with experts in agriculture, GIS, or tech to gain insights and refine your application.

5. Next Steps:
   Prototyping: Begin by creating a basic prototype of FarmCloud to visualize the user interface and basic functionalities.

Technology Deep Dive: Spend time delving deeper into the GIS tools and technologies you plan to use. Understand how they can be integrated into your application effectively.

Project Management: Consider using project management tools like Jira or Trello to plan and track your progress.

Continuous Learning: Stay updated with the latest trends in agricultural technology, GIS, and related fields to ensure FarmCloud remains cutting-edge.

User Testing: As you develop, conduct user testing with a small group to gather feedback and make iterative improvements.

Remember, the key is to build a functional and valuable product incrementally. Prioritize features based on user needs, and don't hesitate to iterate on your MVP based on feedback and insights gained during development.
