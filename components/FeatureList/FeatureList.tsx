    I struggled a lot when ordering farm inputs for my farm because it was difficult or expensive to get what I 
    needed but with Farmcloud, whenever I need seeds or farm inputs, I simply place the order on farmcloud and 
    they are delivered straight to my farm by an agronomist. The agronomist also takes time to check on the crop 
    and advise me on what inputs would be needed next to ensure maximum crop production.
